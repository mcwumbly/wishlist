= Wishlist
===== A tool for making decisions

Wishlist is an application to aid group decision-making.  It can be used to
choose which dishes to make at a dinner party, prioritize a product backlog
or elect a president.

Wishlist aims to allow individual users to maintain their own list of wishes
for a given project, while allowing the group or group leaders to aggregate
these preferences in meaningful ways.

Rather than implementing a single voting system, wishlist allows the group
to weigh the alternatives with greater context from the community.
